    "Convolutional Neural Networks are particularly well suited for image classification. In https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn and https://keras.io/examples/vision/mnist_convnet some well performing examples are given.  \n",
    "1. First, modify the network to include a single convolutional layer, a single pooling layer, and a single fully connected layer only.  (**30%**)  \n",
    "2. Then, incrementally add more complexity and regularization, particularly (**50%**):\n",
    "   1. Implement the network architecture of LeNet5 (shown in the figure).\n",
    "   2. Experiment with other architectures, e.g. getting inspiration from AlexNet.  \n",
    "      AlexNet was designed for much larger input images (227x227) and cannot be applied 1:1 to MNIST images (28x28). Why?\n",
    "   3. Try to further improve the test error. Experiment with regularization and other hyper parameters.\n",
    "      Remember to only use your validation set to tweak your hyper parameters!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Record training and test accuracies with TensorBoard.  (**10%**)  \n",
    "4. How many parameters have your networks, also compared to a standard 128-64-64-10 MLP network from last sheet?  (**10%**)  \n",
    "   How long does it take to train them?"
